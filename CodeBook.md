Data
The tidy_data.txt data file is a text file, containing space-separated values.

The first row contains the names of the variables, which are listed and described in the Variables section, and the following rows contain the values of these variables.

IDENTIFIERS

Subject - The ID of the test subject
Activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

The zip file containing the source data is located at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The following transformations were applied to the source data:

*The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
*The measurements on the mean and standard deviation  were extracted for each measurement.
*The activity identifiers  were replaced with descriptive activity names .
*The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X was expanded to timeDomainBodyAccelerometerMeanX).
*Special characters (i.e. (, ), and -) were removed
*The initial f and t were expanded to frequencyDomain and timeDomain respectively.
*Acc, Gyro, Mag, Freq, mean, and std were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude, Frequency, Mean, and StandardDeviation respectively.
*Replaced  BodyBody with Body.
*From the data set in step 4, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
